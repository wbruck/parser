This is the code for a question answering system.

The easiest way to interact with it is via that included ipython notebook file, answerQueries.ipynb.

If this is not an option, running loadFiles.py will load all of the included corpus text into a saved InvertedIndex file.
Then running runQueries.py will run a small sample of queries from the questions and answers that were created by the institution that created the corpus.
